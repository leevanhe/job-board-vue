## job-board

The "job-board" project is a test project I set up to demonstrate my knowledge of Vue and TypeScript. This project allows me to build a dynamic and interactive frontend for a job board platform, where users can search for job listings, and companies can post job openings. By combining Vue with TypeScript, I aim to showcase my ability to apply modern JavaScript techniques and utilize typing to make the code more reliable and maintainable.

Although the project is still a work in progress, the focus is currently on refining the codebase. Tests still need to be written to ensure the application's stability and proper functionality. Additionally, some components and logic require further refactoring to make the code clearer, more efficient, and scalable.

TypeScript plays a crucial role in this project by enhancing code quality, detecting type errors early, and offering better integrations within the development environment. Together with Vue, a flexible and reactive framework, I aim to demonstrate my ability to develop a modern, robust frontend that is well-structured and ready for further expansion.

With this project, I not only want to highlight my technical skills in Vue and TypeScript but also my ability to create maintainable and scalable solutions.
